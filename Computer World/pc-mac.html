        <p>This type of computer began with the original <b>IBM PC</b> that was introduced in 1981. Other companies began creating similar computers, which were called <b>IBM PC Compatible</b> (often shortened to <b>PC</b>). Today, this is the most common type of personal computer, and it typically includes the <b>Microsoft Windows</b> operating system.</p>
